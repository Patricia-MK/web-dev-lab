In this lab, we set up our development environment by installing Visual Studio Code, Git, and Node.js. We then created our first web page using HTML and opened it in a web browser.
Additionally, we configured Git, created a GitHub repository, and pushed our code to the remote repository. We also explored Git workflow tasks, collaboration, and submitting pull requests.
